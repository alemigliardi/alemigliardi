Hey there!

I'm a graduating Computer Engineering student. I like to keep myself busy and challanged: I am always working on something!

I acquired experience in various IT fields thanks to my projects and hobbies.

I am fascinated with Information and Cyber security, and I take parts to CTFs and relevant competitions whenever I can.
I like electronics and am working on custom musical instruments, both digital (with Arduinos) and analog.
I am a Linux enthusiast and gained experience first-hand: my main machine runs a Linux distro and I deployed (and scrapped) microservices on small VPSes.
I am comfortable with Git, and collaborated with others on shared projects.

I had the opportunity to take part in a stage for a startup working with Machine Learning. While gaining some experience in the field, I built a working unsupervised ML model for outlier detection and matured interest for the field.

I can read documentation and learn autonomously libraries, paradigms and software tools. I want to keep growing, professionalizing myself and learning new skills. I need challanges and tasks to carry on, and I won't stop studying all that is IT.
